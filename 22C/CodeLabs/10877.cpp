/*
Write the implementation (.cpp file) of the Counter class of the previous exercise. The full specification of the class is:
A data member counter of type int.
An data member named limit of type int.
A static int data member named nCounters which is initialized to 0.
A constructor that takes two int arguments and assigns the first one to counter and the second one to limit. It also adds one to the static variable nCounters
A function called increment that accepts no parameters and returns no value. If the data member counter is less than limit, increment just adds one to the instance variable counter.
A function called decrement that accepts no parameters and returns no value. If counter is greater than zero, decrement subtracts one from the counter.
A function called getValue that accepts no parameters. It returns the value of the instance variable counter.
A static function named getNCounters that accepts no parameters and return an int. getNCounters returns the value of the static variable nCounters.
