/*
Write a function named shorten that receives a string object and an integer. The function returns a string formed from 
the first n characters concatenated with the last n characters of the string parameter where n is the integer parameter, 
n is less than or equal to one half of the length of the string. If the result length is shorter, insert a "..." between 
the parts. For example, if the string is "CIS 22B Intermediate Programming Methodology in C++", and the first 10 and the 
last 10 are wanted, the result should be "CIS 22B In...logy in C++".
Test the function using 3 test strings.
